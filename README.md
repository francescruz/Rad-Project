RAD Mashup (Twitter and Google API's mashup)

General notes
The updates on our mashup have helped the functionality.
Fresh batch of tweets would crash under 5 seconds, but it worked successfully with 10 seconds.
The search bar, located in the top right, is used only for the purposes of searching for specific tags, keywords and members.
