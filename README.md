Rad Mashup (Twitter and Google API's mashup)
General notes
The updates on our mashup have helped the functionality.
Getting fresh batch of tweets within 5 seconds will make the website crash, but it worked successfully using 10 seconds

v1: of the website does not have a search bar.

v2: added search bar. it searches words on a tweet.
